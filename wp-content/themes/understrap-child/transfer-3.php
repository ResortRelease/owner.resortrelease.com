          Another of the great “promises” the timeshare salesman probably told you is, 
          “This property has great rental potential!” But what most sales agents don’t 
          know, or don’t care to share with you, is that the resort developers and exchange 
          companies have millions of units of unused inventory that they need to rent as 
          well. These resort developers look at unused inventory rentals as a way to cover 
          costs of marketing their timeshares to new clients. In addition to that, the 
          timeshare exchange companies have a public version of their exchange website where 
          they can rent their unused inventory as an additional revenue stream.
